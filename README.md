# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis 

## 📌 Project Title
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Global Cases Dataset**

## 🎯 Objective
To perform basic data analysis on a COVID-19 dataset using Python to understand:
- Trends over time
- Country-wise impact
- Summary statistics and visual insights

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle  
- Dataset Used: [COVID-19 Time Series Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niketchauhan/covid-19-time-series-data)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Explored the top 5 rows and summary statistics
- Found number of unique countries
- Identified most affected countries by confirmed cases and deaths

## 📈 Visualizations
- Line chart of global confirmed cases over time
- Bar chart showing top 10 countries with highest deaths
- Pie chart comparing global recovered vs deaths

## ✍️ Observations
- Confirmed cases increased rapidly during 2020
- USA, India, and Brazil were most affected
- Recovery rate is much higher than death rate globally

## 📎 How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`COVID19_EDA.ipynb`)
3. Run all cells to view analysis and graphs
